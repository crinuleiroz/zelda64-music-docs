## Message
A message is a chunk of data that tells an audio engine to perform a specific action when reading a music sequence. These actions include — but are not limited to — playing a note, changing instruments, or adjusting volume. Messages are typically represented by one or more bytes and are parsed sequentially.

## Sequence
A sequence is a music file that contains instructions for an audio engine to play back music. The data within the file is parsed and executed in sequential order.
