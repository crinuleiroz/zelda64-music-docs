## Nintendo 64 Emulator

:::tip[Recommended Emulator for In-Game Testing]

    When testing songs in-game, Ares is the recommended emulator. Although Ares is a multi-system emulator, it is the most accurate-to-console emulator for Nintendo 64. It is not advisable to use other multi-system emulators and frontends, such as RetroArch and BizHawk.
